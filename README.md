## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of OpenAI's language models and Lanchain to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from provided text and templates. Unlike traditional tools, which often rely on static rules or databases, this approach leverages the dynamic capabilities of OpenAI's powerful language models to produce contextually relevant MCQs.

## Features

- **Text Input**: Input text from which MCQs will be generated.
- **Automatic Question Generation**: Uses natural language processing (NLP) to generate meaningful questions.
- **Multiple-Choice Options**: Provides plausible distractors (incorrect options) along with the correct answer.
- **Customization**: Adjust the number of questions and complexity.

## Installation
